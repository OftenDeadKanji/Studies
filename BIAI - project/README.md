# Biologically inspired artificial intelligence - project
## Self driving car simulation
We created project in Unity that uses a <b>neural network</b> to drive a 'car' on determined path and avoid collision with walls.
The network is tought using <b>NEAT algorithm</b>. Test happen on certain population of which best subjects are crossed and mutated. The best result is the greatest distance from the start.
